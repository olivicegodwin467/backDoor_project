# Backdoor Project

This project is a simple demonstration of a backdoor implementation in Python. It consists of a server-side listener and a client-side backdoor. The server listens for incoming connections and can send commands to the client to perform actions like downloading/uploading files and executing system commands remotely.

> **Note:** This project is intended for **educational purposes** only. **Do not use this code without explicit permission** from the owner of the target system. Unauthorized access to computer systems is illegal and unethical.

## Features

- **Remote Command Execution**: Executes system commands remotely on the client machine.
- **File Upload/Download**: Allows the server to upload files to and download files from the client.
- **Persistence**: The client continues to run and wait for incoming commands until manually terminated.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/olivicegodwin467/backDoor_project.git
2. Navigate to the Project Directory
bash
Copy
Edit
cd backDoor_project
3. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. You may also need to install some Python dependencies.

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements.txt file contains any libraries or modules the project requires. If there are no specific external dependencies, the project only relies on Python's built-in libraries.

Usage
1. Start the Listener (Server-Side)
Run the server-side listener script to listen for incoming connections from the client:

bash
Copy
Edit
python listener.py
IP and Port: The listener will wait for connections on the IP address and port you specify in the code.

Once the connection is established, you can send commands to the client.

Available Commands:
download <file_path>: Download a file from the client to the server.

upload <file_path>: Upload a file to the client.

exit: Close the connection to the client.

2. Start the Backdoor (Client-Side)
Run the client-side backdoor script on the target machine:

bash
Copy
Edit
python backdoor.py
Connection: The backdoor will attempt to connect to the listener (server) using the specified IP and port.

It will wait for commands from the listener to execute on the client machine.

3. Communication
Once the backdoor is connected, the listener can send commands, and the client will execute them:

Execute System Commands: The listener can send shell commands for execution.

File Transfers: Files can be uploaded to or downloaded from the client machine.

1. listener.py
This is the server-side script that listens for incoming connections from the client and handles commands sent to the client.

2. backdoor.py
This script runs on the client-side. Once connected to the server, it listens for commands from the server, executes them, and sends back results.

3. requirements.txt
This file lists the Python dependencies required for the project (if any).

Example Interaction
1. Start the Listener
bash
Copy
Edit
python listener.py
[+] Waiting for incoming connection...
[+] Connected successfully from ('127.0.0.1', 4444)
2. Start the Backdoor
bash
Copy
Edit
python backdoor.py
3. Sending Commands from the Listener
You can interact with the backdoor by typing commands:

Download a file:

bash
Copy
Edit
download /path/to/file
Upload a file:

bash
Copy
Edit
upload /path/to/file
Execute a system command:

bash
Copy
Edit
ls -la
Exit the connection:

bash
Copy
Edit
exit
